Congratulations on validating the lesson! Here is your high-level command summary checklist, categorized by the specific "checks" and actions you performed across Storage, Secrets, ConfigMaps, and Probes.

### 📦 1. Storage & Persistence (PV/PVC)

| Action | Command | What to Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Apply Storage** | `kubectl apply -f pv.yml` | Ensure no syntax errors in YAML. |
| **Check Volume** | `kubectl get pv` | Status should be **Available**. |
| **Check Claim** | `kubectl get pvc` | Status should be **Bound**. |
| **Verify Persistence** | `kubectl delete Pod [name]` | After recreation, data in `mountPath` should remain. |

---

### 🔐 2. Sensitive Data & Config (Secrets/ConfigMaps)

| Action | Command | What to Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Manual Encode** | `echo -n 'text' | base64` |
| **Inspect Secret** | `kubectl describe secret [name]` | Verify data keys exist (values stay hidden). |
| **Decode Secret** | `kubectl get secret [name] -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode` |
| **Inspect Config** | `kubectl describe cm [name]` | Ensure the configuration file content is correct. |
| **Update Config** | `kubectl edit cm [name]` | Changes apply immediately to the cluster logic. |

### 🛠️ 3. Stateful Operations (MariaDB Instance)

| Action | Command | What to Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Environment Check** | `kubectl exec -it [pod] env | grep MYSQL` |
| **File Injection** | `kubectl exec -it [pod] ls /etc/mysql/conf.d` | Confirm ConfigMap mounted as a file. |
| **Database Access** | `mysql -u root -p${VAR}` | Tests if the Secret-based password actually works. |
| **Variable Check** | `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '...';` | Confirms the ConfigMap actually changed DB behavior. |

---

### 🩺 4. Health & Stability (Probes)

| Action | Command | What to Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Monitor Rollout** | `kubectl get deploy,rs,pods` | Look for the **Ready** column (e.g., `11/12`). |
| **Liveness Failure** | `kubectl describe pod [name]` | Look for `Killing container... failed liveness probe`. |
| **Readiness Failure** | `kubectl get pods` | Status will be `Running` but **Ready** will be `0/1`. |
| **Event Log** | `kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp` | Diagnostic timeline of why probes are failing. |

### 💡 Final Pro-Tip: The "Describe" Hierarchy

When things go wrong in these exercises, always follow this order:

1. `kubectl get pods` (Is it running?)
2. `kubectl describe pod` (Is it a probe failure or a mounting error?)
3. `kubectl logs` (Is the application crashing internally?)
